### Ol√° üëãüèæ

I'm Isabel, a Software Engineer from Portugal.

I‚Äôm passionate about the process of software development, such as the documentation, testing, code reviews, communicating with peers within teams, thinking about solutions to problems, etc. I thrive to learn about software development best practices and apply them to my work, regardless of the technology I‚Äôm working with.

I find very interesting participating in projects since its very beginning to end, and seeing it culminate in a final product while contributing in every aspect of it.

### üåÖ Open Source

In 2018 I was accepted into the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program with [Systers Community](http://systers.io), in which I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/) project. During this program, I started to really like being involved with **Open Source** projects and communities. I loved that I got to work on this project from scratch.

At the moment, I‚Äôm a maintainer of both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I‚Äôve been enjoying the most about being a maintainer is to manage the project contributions and, at the same time, help newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with the help from the community.

### üéì Education

I‚Äôve graduated from Bachelors (2015) and Masters degree (2018) of **Telecommunication and Informatics Engineering** at [T√©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). I‚Äôve developed my Master's thesis [_Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware_](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), which combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.

### üíº Work

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at Globality, working with Python. Previously, I worked with Scala at GeoPhy, and worked as a full stack developer at Impresa. I was also and an Android Developer for 2 years. You can learn more about my professional history on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabelcmdcosta).
