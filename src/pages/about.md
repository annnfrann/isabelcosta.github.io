### Ol√° üëãüèæ

I'm Isabel, a Software Developer from Portugal.

I always try to be open to learning new languages and frameworks depending on the need of the project. I thrive to learning about software development best practices and apply them to my work.

I‚Äôm passionate about the process of software development, such as the documentation, testing, code reviews, communicating with peers within teams, thinking about solutions to problems, etc. I thrive to learn about software development best practices and apply them to my work, regardless of the technology I‚Äôm working with.

I find very interesting participating in projects since its very beginning to end, and seeing it culminate in a final product while contributing in every aspect of it.

### üåÖ Open Source

In 2018 I was accepted into the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program with [Systers Community](http://systers.io), in which I proposed [Mentorship System](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6592097335377920/) project. During this program, I started to really like being involved with **Open Source** projects and communities. I loved that I got to work on this project from scratch.

At the moment, I‚Äôm a maintainer of both backend and android repositories of the Mentorship System. What I‚Äôve been enjoying the most about being a maintainer is to manage the project contributions and, at the same time, help newcomers making their first contribution to open source, while providing a safe environment for them to learn, with the help from the community.

### üéì Education

I‚Äôve graduated from Bachelors (2015) and Masters degree (2018) of **Telecommunication and Informatics Engineering** at [T√©cnico Lisboa](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/). I‚Äôve developed my Master's thesis [_Private Reactive Multipath Communication Middleware_](https://github.com/inesc-id/Premium) at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), which combines multipath communication and route monitoring to react to hijacking attacks.

### üíº Work

I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [Grupo Impresa](http://www.impresa.pt/), a Portuguese group of media products.
During my master degree, I‚Äôve worked as an Android developer for 2+ years in a consulting agency, [INM](https://inm.pt/).
On my third year in college, I interned at a startup, [Uniplaces](https://uniplaces.com/), where I contributed mostly to their web platform.
